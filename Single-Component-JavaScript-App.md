# Overview - Single Component JavaScript app
![](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/blob/master/images/Single%20Compoent%20App%202.png)

* Preserves privacy by synchronously acquiring and FHE transforming biometric data at the edge
* Easy to deploy with no requirement to install additional software, plugins or extensions
* Built with Javascript, TensorFlow.js and an ensemble of helper DNNs
* Works on commodity devices without sacrificing performance 
* Runs on 90% of all modern devices

This Web client authenticates an unlimited number of online users by transmitting FHE payloads to a server, private or public cloud. Identity returns in 300ms. In “off-line mode,” where a network is not present, the client authenticates a maximum of 50 offline users on a modern phone and a few thousand offline users on a laptop. Offline authentication is limited by system resources and returns identity in <10ms. 

Multiple biometric modalities are provided for high risk applications that may require additional biometric authentication mechanisms for step-up authentication. This provides system administrators with the flexibility of requiring a single convenient biometric authentication modality for low-risk applications or more rigorous authentication as needed. The fingerprint biometric modality is recommended to handle difficult cases such as identical twins.

The Web client provides automated visual guidance during prediction and enrollment to assist unsupervised and supervised users in acquiring quality biometrics. The system creates an enrollment package 50 FHE payloads to bind the trusted user identifier (a UUID generated by the system) with the authorized user’s private biometric identity. After enrollment, the Cloud Biometric MFA system may store the enrollment package in the secure element of the user’s device to support offline authentication and/or on a server, within the Cloud Biometric MFA system (i.e. GCP Storage and GCP Memorystore).

The Cloud Biometric MFA system’s prediction capability uses a payload of 3 FHE vectors and returns the UUID of an identity or -1 if not found.

## Architecture Discussion

> Single Component Web app - Logical Block Diagram

The Web app uses fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) methods to ensure privacy, security and confidentiality of the prediction and enrollment packages. To accomplish this, the Web app acquires biometrics using a set of helper DNNs and one pre-trained mobile embedding DNN per biometric modality. These DNNs acquire the biometric using a biometric acquisition workflow and then discard (delete) the plaintext biometric after embedding creation.

The biometric acquisition workflow is implemented as follows. 
* [**Biometric Capture.**](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/wiki/Client-Applications#Web-applications)  The sensor (e.g. phone camera, Webcam, microphone, etc.) acquires a sample of the user’s biometric. 
* [**Geometry DNN**](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/wiki/Biometric-Ingestion-and-Helper-DNNs#face-and-face-wmask-geometry-detection-dnn) - The Geometry DNN determines the (x,y) coordinates of the biometric. 
* [**Validation DNN**](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/wiki/Biometric-Ingestion-and-Helper-DNNs#4-classes-good-blurry-eyeglasses-facemask-validation-dnn) - Validation DNN provides real-time user guidance for acquiring quality biometrics and validates the biometric sample and determines liveness (anti-spoofing).  
* [**Embedding DNN**](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/wiki/Biometric-Ingestion-and-Helper-DNNs#face-facemask-and-fingerprint-embedding-dnns) – The Embedding DNN transforms the validated biometric sample into an encrypted payload (“FHE payload”). 
* **Delete Biometric** – The system then discards (deletes) the original biometric data to eliminate risk of loss and prevent any possible future linkage.

Discuss the workflow that is followed for enrollment.
1. Capture user's biometrics using built-in sensors, Webcams, USB microphones, etc. Captures 10 for enrollment and 3 for prediction.
1. Validate Biometrics. If any of the images are not suitable for training, a message is returned and the image is removed. The user must add more images until at least 10 images meeting the minimum quality standards have been provided.
1. FHE Transform Biometrics
1. Delete Biometrics
1. Server validates FHE enrollment package
1.  Server attempts to match enrollment to existing user. If existing user is matched, server returns UUID without enrolling subject
1. If no match is found, the system extracts the features from the images and stores the features in the system.

If no enrolled subjects are found the system extracts the features from the images and stores the features in the system.

Once the user successfully enrolls, a right check mark will be displayed to the user to notify the completion

If you want face prediction to be more accurate, you can use the URL parameter `profileFaceEnroll`. This parameter will take profile face pictures during enroll. 


### Face Predict

Once the user successfully enrolls in the system, they can verify their identity by predicting with their modality. The same process of scanning the face using the webcam is used for prediction. Once sufficient images are captured, the software extracts the features from the images and sends it to the model for identifying the person. Then, the results will be displayed in the frontend identyfing the user that the software has recognized.

#### Capture Face

#### Prediction Result

Private Identity’s facial recognition app detects a subject, determines if its image resides in the database instantaneously and, finally, takes whatever further action is required, allowing access only for an approved user.

### Voice Enroll and Predict

Utilizing biometric voice technology, a phrase spoken by a subject is captured and then compared with a previously stored voiceprint. Identifying an individual by voice is a complex task because the human voice is influenced by multiple characteristics, physical, behavioral and emotional.  A voiceprint is algorithmically derived based on an analysis of these factors.

Upon enrollment, Private Identity’s biometric software records and registers the subject’s voice sample. The statistical algorithm analyzes the many distinctive characteristics of the voice and creates a voiceprint or biometric model which is then encrypted and stored in a secure database.

When a subject attempts subsequent logins, the system automatically creates a voice model and compares it with the stored sample. If successful authentication occurs, the subject is allowed access.  The human voice is as unique an identifier as the retina, iris or fingerprints.  No matter how well aspects of pitch, cadence and intonation are attempted via impersonation, it is impossible to fool the referenced voiceprint in Private Identity’s database.

When the biometric voice option is enabled, the user will be requested to speak live sentences that are displayed in the browser.

The browser records the spoken voice and extracts the features. These features are used in the same way as face to aide the enroll / predict process.

### Fingerprint Enroll

_System under progress._

Fingerprint scanning is the most ubiquitous biometric technology, utilized for everything from access to cellphones and personal computers to entry at high-security installations.  It used to be the “bad guys” who were fingerprinted. Today, this unique human characteristic provides corporations, government and individuals with an immediate, fool-proof tool for identity authentication.

During enrollment, or initial capture of a subject’s fingerprint, each print is analyzed for the unique features and lines found on every individual’s fingers. The software app measures the distances and angles between these features and then uses an algorithm to turn this information into a unique numeric code. Comparing fingerprints then becomes a process of comparing codes. If the codes match, the prints match, and the subject is granted access.

When using a fingerprint to verify a subject's identity, the user will be asked to display their thumb for webcam image capture. A guided area will be displayed in the browser to cover the fingerprint region. Once the systems approves the quality of the image, features extracted from the fingerprint image will be sent to the system for enroll and predict.
