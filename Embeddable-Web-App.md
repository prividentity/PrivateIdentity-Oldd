In this tutorial, we are going to explore how to download the web app and deploy it. This tutorial assumes you have an HTTPS domain, where you want to have the app running.



## Downloading Files

The first step is to click on [this link](http://private.id/stand-alone-app.zip) to download the app. Once the download finishes, we can see two folders and one file: dist, src, and `index.htm`. The dist folder contains the necessary JS files and images. The src folder have the machine learning models. And finally, the `index.htm` file is one we should use to run the app.


## Running the App

Once we upload the two extracted folders and the HTML file, we should be able to run it, through the `index.htm` file. So, if you uploaded the app to `example.org`, then you should go to example.org/index.htm?apiKey=XXXXXX. It's important to use the `apiKey` parameter with the proper value, or otherwise the app won't work.

## Using the App

Once we have the app running, we can see the homepage like this:

You can now use all the app features and URL parameters. And that's it!
