### SAML Overview

Our biometric technologies are compliant with SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) standards. The latest standardized version of the protocol is 2.0, and it is the one we support. 

In this document, the workflow is explained with examples on Google GSuite and Microsoft Azure Directory. The process should begin at our authentication application, then move to the external parties (Google and Microsoft in this case). Once we connect with such entities, we can redirect back to, for example, your GMail, or your Outlook account.
