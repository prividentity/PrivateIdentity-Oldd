## Okta
<br/>
Okta, Inc. is a publicly-traded identity and access management company based in San Francisco. It provides cloud software that helps companies manage and secure user authentication into modern applications, and for developers to build identity controls into applications, website web services, and devices.   

Okta as a service provider provides authentication services across many identity management firms. In our case, we have used Okta as a service provider while using our services as an Identity Provider. This is achieved by handshaking the SAML authentication during the verification process between Okta and Private Identity.
