# SYSTEM OVERVIEW 
![Solution Diagram](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/blob/master/images/mfa%20solution%20diagram%201.png)
The Cloud Biometric MFA system determines if the biometric sample from an untrusted user is valid and matches a previously enrolled subject. The system may present the end user with no UI (i.e. a camera or microphone with no UI) or a minimal GUI. 

The system preserves privacy by transmitting, storing and using only system data and not processing any user data (“personal data”), biometric data or biometric templates. As such, it is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA and BIPA and does not incur legal obligations under these laws (link for additional information on privacy).  
The system authenticates an unlimited number of users online by transmitting FHE payloads to a server, private or public cloud. Identity returns in 300ms. In “off-line mode,” where a network is not present, the system authenticates a maximum of 50 users (dependent on device resources).

Face, face with mask, fingerprint and voice biometric modalities are provided for high risk applications that may require additional biometric authentication mechanisms for step-up authentication. This provides system administrators with the flexibility of requiring a single convenient biometric authentication modality for low-risk applications or more rigorous authentication as needed. The fingerprint biometric modality is recommended to handle difficult cases such as identical twins.

The Cloud Biometric MFA system’s included Web GUI provides automated visual guidance during prediction and enrollment to assist unsupervised and supervised users in acquiring quality biometrics. The system creates an enrollment package 50 FHE payloads to bind the trusted user identifier (a UUID generated by the system) with the authorized user’s private biometric identity. After enrollment, the Cloud Biometric MFA system may store the enrollment package in the secure element of the user’s device to support offline authentication and/or on a server, within the Cloud Biometric MFA system (i.e. GCP Storage and GCP Memorystore).

## Block Diagram

Cloud Biometric MFA uses fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) methods to ensure privacy, security and confidentiality of the prediction and enrollment packages.  FHE provides secure storage and secure computation by allowing the cloud to calculate the similarity (geometric distance) between two sets of FHE payloads in their encrypted form.
To accomplish this, the system acquires biometrics using a set of helper DNNs and one pre-trained mobile embedding DNN per biometric modality. These DNNs acquire the biometric using a biometric acquisition workflow and then discard (delete) the plaintext biometric after embedding creation.

Cloud Biometric MFA then performs encrypted match and encrypted search using a second set of classifying DNNs. These DNNs classify an unlimited number of FHEs and return identity in constant time when deployed on load-balanced, elastic, fault-tolerant Kubernetes clusters and GCP’s Cloud AI service. Testing at 100,000 FHE payloads/second (simulating 8B authentications/day, or similar to the daily volume of Azure Active Directory) using the above configuration responded in 235ms _constant time_.

* [**Biometric Capture.**](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/wiki/Client-Applications#Web-applications)  The sensor (e.g. phone camera, Webcam, microphone, etc.) acquires a sample of the user’s biometric. 
* [**Geometry DNN**](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/wiki/Biometric-Ingestion-and-Helper-DNNs#face-and-face-wmask-geometry-detection-dnn) - The Geometry DNN determines the (x,y) coordinates of the biometric. 
* [**Validation DNN**](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/wiki/Biometric-Ingestion-and-Helper-DNNs#4-classes-good-blurry-eyeglasses-facemask-validation-dnn) - Validation DNN provides real-time user guidance for acquiring quality biometrics and validates the biometric sample and determines liveness (anti-spoofing).  
* [**Embedding DNN**](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/wiki/Biometric-Ingestion-and-Helper-DNNs#face-facemask-and-fingerprint-embedding-dnns) – The Embedding DNN transforms the validated biometric sample into an encrypted payload (“FHE payload”). 
* **Delete Biometric** – The system then discards (deletes) the original biometric data to eliminate risk of loss and prevent any possible future linkage. 
* **FHE Payload Validation** – Process by which the server verifies the integrity of the FHE payload received by the API endpoint.  
* [**Identification**](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/wiki/Biometric-Matching-Algorithms) – The custom Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) running on the Cloud AI service performs an encrypted match or encrypted search.  The UUID returned in the rank 1 position is then provided to the 1:1 Verify function. 
* **1:1 Verify** - The system retrieves the rank 1 UUID’s original FHE enrollment package stored in Cloud Storage and uses procedural programming to calculate the similarity (geometric distance) between the two sets of vector data in their encrypted form. This step is 99.99% accurate and eliminates false positives. 
* Security Management Functions – Cloud Biometric MFA provides management functions for administrators that include deleting users and reviewing audit log information. 

## Enrollment
Cloud Biometric MFA [enrollment](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/wiki/IEEE-2410-2020-Standard-for-Biometric-Privacy-(SBP)-Server#API-Enroll-Overview) usually occurs as part of the user’s enrollment into a larger system. The system creates an enrollment package (set of 50 FHE payloads) to bind the trusted user identifier (a UUID generated by the system) with the authorized user’s private biometric identity. After enrollment, the Cloud Biometric MFA system may store the enrollment package in the secure element of the local device (for later offline authentication) and/or within the Cloud Biometric MFA system (i.e. GCP Storage, GCP Memorystore and Cloud AI). Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) methods ensure confidentiality and detect modifications of the enrollment package. 

## Prediction 
The system creates a [prediction](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/wiki/IEEE-2410-2020-Standard-for-Biometric-Privacy-(SBP)-Server#Predict-Overview) package (set of six FHE payloads) from live biometric sample(s) captured from the end user.  The prediction package is then validated by the FHE payload validation function and an encrypted match is identified by the Cloud AI service. An empty result is returned if no encrypted match is identified. If an encrypted result (UUID) is returned by the Identify function, this result is used by the 1:1 Verify function to calculate the similarity between prediction package and the user’s original enrollment package.  An encrypted result (UUID) is returned if a trusted user is identified.
