## OVERVIEW
* <b>Provides fast and accurate Cloud Biometric MFA</b> to businesses, governments and nonprofits.

* <b>Integrates easily</b> into your IAM solution or applications using the included Javascript component (embedded DIV), JavaScript APIs, REST APIs, SAML 2.0 or OAuth/OIDC.

* <b>Deploys instantly </b>across every modern browser, device, platform and cloud with no client software to install and no hardware to buy.

* <b>Guarantees privacy </b>with built-in [Fully Homomorphic Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_biometrics) (FHE). This first-to-market cryptography solution fully complies with GDPR, CCPA and BIPA and is currently the only solution certified compliant with [IEEE 2410 Standard for Biometric Privacy](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/wiki/IEEE-2410-STANDARD-FOR-BIOMETRIC-PRIVACY-%5BDRAFT%5D).

* <b>Recognizes everybody equally </b>across all ethnicities, skin tones, genders and ages without discrimination. The mobile DNNs also accommodate boundary conditions with up to 30% occlusions including facial hair, abrasions, masks, and blurry or rotated images.

* <b>Free for 30 days!</b> Talk to us on Github, AWS Marketplace Portal and Google Meet. We are looking forward to working with you.

Go to market faster with built-in integrations for popular IAM solutions, SAML 2.0 and OAuth/OIDC. Use SaaS or PaaS running in the cloud or on the edge. REST APIs and Javascript APIs are available for embedded apps.

### No Discrimination
![Image of No Discrimination](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/blob/master/images/No%20Discrim%201.png)<br>
Private Identity’s deep learning technology maintains absolute accuracy across all ethnicities, skin tones, genders, age, and faces and fingerprints. Recognition is accurate with up to 30% occlusions including facial hair, abrasions, masks, blurry images and image rotations. 

### Facial Recognition 
![woman's face](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/blob/master/images/Face%20Recogni%201.png)<br>
Authenticate, verify, identify and search an unlimited gallery in real time. Absolute accuracy (IR=99.99%) with almost no false positives (FPIR=0.0001% ). Runs on any modern browser, device, platform or cloud with any standard camera >256kB. Returns identity in 300ms.

### Face + Mask Recognition  
![woman wearing face mask](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/blob/master/images/Face%20w%20Mask%201.png)
Authenticate, verify, identify and search an unlimited gallery in real time. Highly accurate (IR=98.59%) with almost no false positives (FPIR=0.0001% ). Runs on any modern browser, device or platform with any standard camera >256kB. Returns identity in 300ms.

### Voice (Speaker) Identification 
![man speaking into phone](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/blob/master/images/voice%20recogni%201.png)
Authenticate, verify, identify and search an unlimited gallery of human voices in real time. Voice identity is text, language and accent agnostic and highly accurate (IR=92.5%) with nearly zero false positives (FPIR=0.0001%). Requires at least one second of any spoken voice at 8.1kHz (telephone audio quality). Runs on any modern browser, device, platform or cloud. Returns identity in 300ms. 

### Fingerprint Identification
![man's finger](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/blob/master/images/fingerprint%20recogni%201.png)
Authenticate, verify, identify and search an unlimited number of user’s fingerprints in real time. Absolute accuracy (IR=99.99%) with nearly zero false positives (FPIR=0.0001%). Runs on any modern browser, device, platform or cloud with any standard camera >2MB. Returns identity in 300ms. 

### Additional Features

#### Image and Video Anti-Spoofing (Liveness)
Determines if the image source is a photo or video attack. 

#### Blink Detection
Determines if a user's is blinking his or her eyes.

#### Mask Detection
Detects if a user is wearing a face mask.

#### Eyeglass Detection
Detects if a user is wearing eyeglasses.



#### Voice Liveness
Requires the user to read a random sentence. User must say the correct words. Supports eight languages.

#### Offline Authentication
Web clients automatically switch to Local Mode for face and fingerprint recognition after loss of network connectivity.
