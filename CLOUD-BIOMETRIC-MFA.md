## OVERVIEW
* <b>Provides fast and accurate Cloud Biometric MFA</b> to businesses, governments and nonprofits.

* <b>Integrates easily</b> into your IAM solution or applications using the included Javascript component (embedded DIV), JavaScript APIs, REST APIs, SAML 2.0 or OAuth/OIDC.

* <b>Deploys instantly </b>across every modern browser, device, platform and cloud with no client software to install and no hardware to buy.

* <b>Guarantees privacy </b>with built-in [Fully Homomorphic Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_biometrics) (FHE). This first-to-market cryptography solution fully complies with GDPR, CCPA and BIPA and is currently the only solution certified compliant with [IEEE 2410 Standard for Biometric Privacy](https://github.com/openinfer/PrivateIdentity/wiki/IEEE-2410-STANDARD-FOR-BIOMETRIC-PRIVACY-%5BDRAFT%5D).

* <b>Recognizes everybody equally </b>across all ethnicities, skin tones, genders and ages without discrimination. The mobile DNNs also accommodate boundary conditions with up to 30% occlusions including facial hair, abrasions, masks, and blurry or rotated images.

* <b>Free for 30 days!</b> Talk to us on Github, AWS Marketplace Portal and Google Meet. We are looking forward to working with you.
