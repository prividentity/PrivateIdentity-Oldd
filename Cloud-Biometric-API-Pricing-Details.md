### Use Models and APIs to Enable Intelligence Vision and Search
Cloud Biometric API uses state-of-the-art face, face+face mask, voice and fingerprint algorithms to detect and recognize human biometrics in images and audio. Capabilities include features like face detection and face identification. 

There are two types of fees.

__Biometric Recognition__: Cloud Biometric API charges you each time you analyze a biometric using our mobile DNNs or APIs. Running multiple DNNs or APIs against a single biometric counts as processing multiple biometrics.

__Biometric Metadata Storage__: To enroll a person, you will need to store a repository of anonymized metadata against which Cloud Biometric API can search for matches. Storage charges are applied monthly.
