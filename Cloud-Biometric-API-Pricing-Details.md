### Cloud Biometric API Uses Models and APIs to Enable Recognition and Search
Cloud Biometric API uses state-of-the-art face, face+face mask, voice and fingerprint algorithms to detect and recognize human biometrics in images and audio. Capabilities include features like face detection and face identification. 

#### There are two types of fees.
**Biometric Recognition**: Cloud Biometric API charges you each time you analyze a biometric using a DNN or API. Using multiple features (DNNs or APIs) against a single biometric counts as processing multiple biometrics. 

**Biometric Metadata Storage**: Cloud Biometric API stores a repository of anonymized metadata during enrollment against which Cloud Biometric API can search for matches. Storage charges are applied monthly.

#### Pricing Table
