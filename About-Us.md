We created Private Identity to solve cryptography’s “holy grail,” fully homomorphic encryption. Our small team of ML engineers solved FHE in 2018 and was granted cryptography patents for FHE in 2019, 2020 and 2021. FHE conceals the input data, output data and the occurrence of the search itself.

Private Identity’s FHE algorithm is a 1-way cryptographic hash that irreversibly encrypts biometric data while enabling encrypted match and encrypted search operations on the encrypted dataset. Operating in this encrypted space fully mitigates the regulatory and legal risk of biometric data. Indeed, the GDPR, CCPA, BIPA and HIPAA privacy laws specifically state that they do not apply to anonymized data. Building on this, the new [IEEE 2410-2021 Standard for Biometric Privacy](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/2410-2021.html) provides that conforming FHE systems are,  “exempt from GDPR, CCPA, BIPA and HIPAA privacy law obligations.”

In addition to privacy, FHE provides extreme accuracy, speed, security and efficiency benefits. We look forward to meeting you and helping to support your cybersecurity mission.
