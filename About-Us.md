## About Us
Private Identity LLC is a Washington DC-based AI/ML software company that provides secure, accurate and private biometric identity across all major browsers, devices and platforms. The societal good achieved with fully homomorphic encryption is full privacy.

Our underlying technology was developed by a small group of top computer scientists and ML engineers. We converged on a solution to fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in early 2018. Our first cryptography patent for FHE was granted in September 2019. Sixteen additional patents are granted or under application worldwide.
