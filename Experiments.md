# Experiments
## Webcam Use Modalities

In order to better understand which environments can be used when gathering fingerprint images, an experiment was conducted with four different environments. The four environments consisted of; Utilizing only the light from the device's screen in a pitch black room, Utilizing a flash light from another device in a dim room to illuminate the finger, utilizing outside conditions with the sun out as a light source, and the control being in a well-lit room under normal circumstances. 

Here are the results:

### Backlight Conditions


This condition was created in a pitch dark room, using only the devices screen as a light source to illuminate the finger. The results were the ridges on the finger were visually identifiable but of the four environments, this condition consistently provided the worse images. This environment was relatively easy to achieve since all that was required was the lights to be turned off.

### Flashlight Conditions


This condition was  created in a dimly lit room, using a flashlight to illuminate the finger. The results were the ridges of the finger were identifiable, but it seemed to be that the saturation was perhaps too low, causing the images of the finger to not be as well defined, and were 'greyed' in a way upon viewing the images.  This environment is not easy to replicate as it takes 3 hands for the process to take place, one to hold the flashlight in a proper position if it is not stationary and one hand for the finger, and another hand to initiate the image capturing process.

### Outside Conditions

This condition was created outside with no shade, with the sun being the light source. The results were phenomenal as the ridges were very easily defined, and a noticeable feature is the finger looks more saturated. This means that the finger almost looks 'wet', or has some form of 'grease' on it that makes the ridges very easily identifiable. This environment is relatively easy to replicate since the only condition is being outside. 

### Standard Conditions

This condition was created in a well-lit room with the room's lights being the primary light source. The result were varying as depending on where the lights are situated in comparison to the camera the image quality differed. The best quality image in this condition can be achieved if the camera is angled in a way that the finger is completely lit from the room's lights. This can be difficult to replicate since the camera may need to be adjusted in a way to light up the finger, or the lights in the room may need to be adjusted, and/or moved to highlight the finger.
