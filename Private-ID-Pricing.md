### Cloud pay-as-you-go pricing
Private IDÂ® uses state-of-the-art face with facemask, voice and fingerprint algorithms to detect and recognize human biometrics in images and audio. Capabilities include models and APIs that locate biometric geometry, validate biometrics and perform identification. 

Requests for Private ID services are billed by Product SKU under a standard pay-as-you-go pricing model. One or more Product SKUs are triggered for each request, depending on the fields that are specified in the request. 

Invalid requests do not incur fees. Examples of invalid requests include images of an empty room, audios containing silence and spoofed face images.

### Billable Units 
**Billable Units**: Each component, model, API or service applied to a biometric is a billable unit. Using multiple components, models, APIs or services against a single biometric image or audio counts as processing multiple billable units. For example, if you apply Face Landmarks, Blur Detection and Face Identification (3 models) to the same image, you are billed for three billable units. 

**Metadata Storage**: Private ID stores a repository of anonymized metadata during enrollment against which Private ID searches for matches. Storage charges are applied monthly per enrolled subject. Metadata storage fees are prorated daily. If each day during the month a customer enrolled 1,000 subjects for a few hours and then deleted them each night, the customer would still be billed for 1,000 metadata storage each day. 

**Free Tier** 
Get started at no cost. The Free Tier allows you to make your first 50,000 requests for free.  

### Pricing Table - Product SKUs

Pricing is based on monthly usage for both billable units and metadata storage. The table below sets out the Private ID "pay-as-you-go" pricing in US dollars (USD). 

| SKU | Description | Each Request | Throughput |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- | :-----------: | 
| PRIV00 | **Free** First 50,000 Requests | $0.000 | 10K API calls/sec|
| PRIV01 | Request (each) | $0.001 | 10K API calls/sec |
| PRIV02 | Metadata Storage/User/Month | $0.001| 10K API calls/sec |
| PRIV03 | Remote Onboarding/KYC/AML | $0.15 | 10K API calls/sec |
| PRIV10 | Enhanced Profile Merge | $0.20 | $200.00 | 10K API calls/sec |
| PRIV11 | Augmented Profile Merge | $0.35 | $350.00 | 10K API calls/sec |

Request higher throughput as needed. This AWS API Gateway default limit is adjustable. 
Each model, API, or service request counts as one billable unit. 

### Product SKU Usage Counter Details 
* SKU counters reset to zero on the first day of each calendar month at 12 AM PST (UTC-8). 

### Example 1
If your application made the following requests in a one-month period:
* 700 Face Enrollments, where each enrollment requested six models
  * Face Landmark DNN
  * Blur Detection DNN
  * Image Spoof Detection DNN
  * Video Spoof Detection DNN
  * Eyeglass Detection DNN
  * Face 1:n Identification DNN

Your cost would be $4.20, or $0.006/enrollment. This is calculated by multiplying 700 enrolled persons by six Tier 1 units, or (700 x 6 x $0.00100).

### Example 2
If your application made the following requests in a one-month period:
* 5000 Face Authentications, where each authentication requested five models 
  * Face Landmark DNN
  * Blur Detection DNN
  * Image Spoof Detection DNN 
  * Video Spoof Detection DNN
  * Face Identification DNN

Your cost would be $25.00, or $0.00500/prediction. This is calculated by multiplying 5000 persons times 5 Tier 1 units, or (5000 Authentications x 5 Requests x $0.00100).

### Example 3
If your application enrolled 1000 subjects on the 15th day of a month containing 30 days, the Anonymized Metadata Storage cost for those 1000 enrollments in a one-month period would be $0.50, or $0.0005/enrollment. The cost is calculated by multiplying (15 days x 1000 face enrollments x $0.00100/month), and then dividing the product by 30 days. 

Invoices are rounded up to the next penny once at the end of each billing cycle.
