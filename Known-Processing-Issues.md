## Face Recognition 
* Must be combined with voice and/or fingerprint recognition to distinguish between identical twins (monozygotic)
* Accurately recognizes children but has only been tested using adult images due to policy restrictions

## Voice Recognition 
* Does not return identity when audio contains more than one subject, loud background noises and/or poor audio input quality
