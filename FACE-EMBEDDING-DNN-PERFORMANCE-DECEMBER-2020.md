### EMBEDDING DNN PERFORMANCE ### 

***
### VALIDATION ACCURACY OF SOFTMAX TRAINING ###

**Face recognition DNN trained with 54M images** and 83425 people with validation accuracy of 91.62% using 4M images for validation.

### TRIPLET LOSS TRAINING ###

** We haven't started the triplet loss training yet.

Data visualization is from TensorFlowâ€™s TensorBoard visualization toolkit

### CUTOFF ANALYSIS USING 20K RANDOM IMAGES ###

The cutoff analysis is then calculated using a random segment of the evaluation set.

This is used for a starting point on a multi-variable cutoff analysis.  We choose 20,000 random images from the evaluation set and measured DNN performance by accuracy, precision and recall.

### THRESHOLD ANALYSIS ###

**Threshold** analysis using the same 20,000 random images from the evaluation dataset. This analysis assists in further optimization considering min, mean and max thresholds in deriving the multi-value cutoff.

**Line 867 (highlighted) provides 1.14 as the optimal threshold.**  
This results in an accuracy of F1=99%, 30 false positives and 11 false negatives. This is asymptotic to 100% accuracy.
